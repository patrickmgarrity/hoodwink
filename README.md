We give you visibility into your SaaS application adoption in minutes, providing you with a list of applications and user adoption associated with those to help save you money and increase your security.

Over the past decade organizations have scaled to meet demand while adopting newer SaaS based technologies. Organizations now have a large footprint of SaaS applications often surpassing 100â€™s of apps such as Microsoft Office 365, Zoom, Salesforce, Hubspot and Atlassian. These applications come with a large bill that has all too often gone unchecked with the pervasive economic growth experienced in the last decade. The challenge is that most SaaS subscriptions are purchased with the intent of making applications accessible to all resulting in a significant increase in unnecessary cost due to purchasing licenses that continue to go unused.

Itâ€™s time to take back the SaaS tax resulting from unused licensing and premium upsells and reduce our costs from bloated SaaS spending. Welcome to Hoodwink!
